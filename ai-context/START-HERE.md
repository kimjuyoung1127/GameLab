# AI Context Start Here

Use this file first to reduce context load and token usage.

## Active Docs (read in order)
1. `ai-context/master-plan.md`
2. `ai-context/project-context.md`
3. `ai-context/archive/2026-02-12/sprint-close-2026-02-12-s12.5.md`
4. `ai-context/claude-coding-guideline.md`
5. `ai-context/codex-review-guideline.md`

## Logs
- Current session logs: `ai-context/logs/`

## Archive
- Older handoff/log/report docs moved to:
  - `ai-context/archive/2026-02-11/`
  - `ai-context/archive/2026-02-12/`

## Rule
- Prefer active docs only for normal work.
- Open archive docs only when historical trace is required.
